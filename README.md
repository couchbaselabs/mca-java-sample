# Couchbase MCA Sample Project

This project makes use of the Couchbase Multi-Cluster Aware Java client.  Using this client,
database loads will automatically transfer to alternative clusters if nodes become unavailable.  See
the Tutorial document in this repo for a walk through of setting up a multi-master, multi-region
cluster.

This client is currently available only as an Enterprise Edition feature (as of 2/6/2018).  You
will not be able to build this sample without the client.  For more information, please contact
a Couchbase sales representative (<sales@couchbase.com>).
